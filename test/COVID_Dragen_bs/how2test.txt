To test the COVIDSeq template in this package:
1. Create an RStudio project with the name 2022-08-01_COVIDSeq_test
2. Initialize a COVIDSeq template
	- rmarkdown::draft(file = "2022-08-01_COVIDSeq_test_QC_Report.Rmd", template = "covid_dragen_bs", package = "RmdTemplates", create_dir = FALSE)
3. Copy the metadata folder from RmdTemplates and replace the metadata folder in the initialized project
4. In the preamble.Rmd file, change the sequencing_folder_fp to where the test run folder is located (should be same file location as this text file)
5. Generate the metadata sheet and knit the QC_Report.Rmd
6. Compare lineage results in the epi csv file with the test_RLU csv file
